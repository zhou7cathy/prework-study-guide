        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The h1-h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. </li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>  
          <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>We combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>Text-align: center is a positioning peroperty to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
