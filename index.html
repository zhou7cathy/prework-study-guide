          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The h1-h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>

          <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

          <li>We combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
